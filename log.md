# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 30, 2020


**Today's Progress**: worked on C++ project for school a little bit but really struggling. To combat this I laid out a plan to tackle the topics that I need to study in order to understand how to put this project together. After planning and reviewing what I will need to study, I have realized it is not all that daunting, and that I in fact have until January 31 to complete the course. However I am going to set a hard deadline for submitting the project for January 15. Hopefully I will be able to finish it sooner than that. Possibly the last week of December or first week of january? We'll see.

**Thoughts:** For now I am going to focus on learning the few things that I need to brush up on to pass the assessment for the web development course. It is not much, just some basic javascript, apis, and animations. I think I should be able to schedule this test in two weeks or less if I study every day. As of now, I do not have the time for any personal projects with the project I am working on in C++ and the assessment I am studying for in front end web development.

### Day 2: December 1, 2020


**Today's Progress**: I worked on my web development applications course for school. This required just reading about javascript and reviewing some examples of code. After studying about the drag and drop html api, I made a simple game to drag cats across a river that was made to appear flowing via css animations and drop them in a box. It is not done. I want a message to appear after dropping the kittens that says something like, Good job! you saved all the Kitties!!

**Thoughts:** Today was good practice with CSS and DOM manipulation and my first time working with the drag and drop api as well as using keyframes and animations. I looked my questions up on google and stackoverflow when I got stuck and followed a tutorial to make the css animations.


### Day 3: December 2,3,4, 2020


**Today's Progress**: I spent the past 3 evenings on studying bootstrap and building a front end design for my computer repair shop app. This gives me a GREAT idea of everything I will need to do to finish putting it together. I am only going to count it as one day because I only spent maybe an hour each day on this.
